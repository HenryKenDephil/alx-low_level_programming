bit manipulation.
the bit manipulaiton is made up of many operations such as;
AND(&); it's a binary operator that takes two bits at a time and perform AND operations. its result is 1 when both bits are 1.
bitwise OR(I) takes two bits at a time and perform OR operation. the result is 0 when both bits are 0.
bitwise NOT(~) is not a unary operator. its work is to complement each bit one by one. the result of NOT is 0 when bit is 1 and 1 when bit is 0
