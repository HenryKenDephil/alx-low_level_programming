Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function. there are four types of recursion; the direct and indirect recursion, as well as tail and non-tail recursion. recursions are more mathematical. it's widely used to calculate factorials of a number and fibonacci numbers
